AquaCrop-OS is a free, open-source implementation of AquaCrop, a crop water productivity model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). AquaCrop-OS is coded in Matlab and Octave, and reproduces all features of the FAO AquaCrop model up to version 6.0 with the current exception of fertility stress, salinity stress, and weed management. 

AquaCrop-OS simulates yield response to water for multiple crop types and environmental conditions, and is designed specifically for regions where water is a critical limiting factor in crop production. AquaCrop-OS is intended for use by both scientists and practitioners, and requires minimal data inputs in comparison with most other crop models.

AquaCrop-OS introduces several new innovative features on top of those provided by the base GUI and PlugIn versions of the FAO AquaCrop model, including
(1) Support for multiple operating systems (Windows, Macintosh OS X and Linux).
(2) Capacity to run parallel model simulations to reduce run times of computationally intensive tasks.
(3) Easy linkage with other models via the Open Modelling Interface to support water policy analysis.
